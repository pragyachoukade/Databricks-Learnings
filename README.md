# Databricks-Learnings

I have recently delved into the world of data engineering, specifically focusing on Databricks and Azure services. Through hands-on experience, I have gained proficiency in performing various transformations and creating a data lake in Azure.

In my learning, I have utilized Delta tables to enhance data management capabilities, leveraging functionalities such as versioning, time travel, and schema enforcement. Additionally, I have explored Delta table optimization techniques to improve query performance and overall data processing efficiency.

One of the highlights of my learning journey includes implementing incremental loading using Auto Loader in Databricks. This feature has allowed me to efficiently ingest new data into existing Delta tables, ensuring data consistency and minimizing processing time.

I am excited to continue honing my skills in data engineering and exploring new technologies to drive impactful insights from data.
